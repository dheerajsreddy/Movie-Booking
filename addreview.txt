Rohith Kumar:
Overall, Asuran is a must-watch. Dhanush-Vetrimaaran combo who has once again delivered a raw, rustic and riveting revenge drama. Don't miss this one! 
Vetrimaaran’s Asuran is a revenge drama that talks about land grabbing, oppression and caste politics in  Tamilnadu's Kovilpatti and surrounding areas between the ‘60s to ‘80s.  Based on Poomani’s novel, Vekkai (with a few changes of course), the politics handled in the film stays relevant even now and it’s a superbly crafted rural gem.

My one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,"I used to think that my life is a TRAGEDY but now i realise that it is nothing but COMEDY"....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it's theme being 'TRAGEDY=COMEDY'...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!
It has got those 'Dark Knight' (arguably one of the finest superhero movie ever made) vibes.

Syeraa Narasimha Reddy is truly a worth watching movie for every Indian who loves his/her motherland. The story of this forgotten hero from Rayalaseema of Andhra Pradesh inspires every audience so much so that they will certainly think about the sincere and honest sacrifices of their ancestors of the foregone era and feel it a privilege to be born as a proud Indian in loving their motherland and sacrificing their lives too for the freedom of the nation
